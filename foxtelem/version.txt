1.03
 * Version 1.03 of FOX TELEM is available for download this brings several important new features:
 * Support larger volumes of data with much better speed in a segmented database
 * Auto detect high speed vs low speed telemetry
 * Allow the user to swap IQ channels in IQ mode
 * Allow graphs to be plotted as points (without lines)
 * Plot more labels on horizontal axis when many resets plotted and fixed some graph formatting issues
 * Graph formatting parameters are saved to config and reloaded when FoxTelem is restarted
 * When reset button pressed on graphs the average period is reset too
 * Swapped min/max values for solar panel temp on 1A
 * Fox-1A Solar panel voltage was (incorrectly) using the MPPT conversion
 * Fixed bug where HighSpeed Frames were unnecessarily held in the queue until the pass was finished
 * Cap max RSSI in the lookup table at -140dB to avoid spurious readings
 * Interpolate the middle of two samples for first difference calculation, for more accurate TCA calculation
 * Add SAFE mode bit to the Computer panel so that it can be graphed
 * Fixed bug where Radiation Graphs did not open at start up
 * Fixed bug where T0 file could be corrupted if URL returned bogus data
 * Fixed bug where FoxTelem gave many error messages but did not quit if the log dir was not writable
 * Skip NULL values for some measurements.  Don't plot continuous labels to left of vertical axis.
 * MEMS diagnostic values are now in dps (vs Volts)
 * Fixed bug where radiation data could not be saved to CSV files
 * Fixed bug where FindSignal failed to lock if Track Doppler was not checked
 It also provides Support for Fox-1Cliff and Fox-1D:
 * Display HERCI High Speed frames on the Herci Tab
 * Display HERCI Housekeeping frames
 * Support the Fox-1D low res camera format
 * Implemented MPPT panel temperature conversion using Cubic fit
 * Sort camera images by reset and uptime not picture counter
 * Save position of the HERCI HS tab horizontal divider
 * Allow the user to specify the number of thumb nails to display on the camera tab
 * Display converted HERCI Housekeeping data
